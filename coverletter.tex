\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,} 
 
% \noindent PARAGRAPH ONE: State reason for letter, name the position or type 
% of work you are applying for and identify source from  which  you 
% learned   of   the  opening.  (i.e.  Career  Development  Center, 
% newspaper, employment service, personal contact).
\noindent My name is Daniel Cheng, I am a 3rd year senior Computer Science
student in the Turing Scholars Honors Program here at The University of Texas at
Austin. As I will be graduating in May 2015, I am applying for a full-time
position at the ARL. I spoke with David Brunke at the Natural Sciences Career
Fair, and he recommended this position to me.

% \noindent PARAGRAPH  TWO:  Indicate why you are interested in the position, 
% the company, its products, services - above all, stress what  you 
% can  do  for  the employer. If you are a recent graduate, explain 
% how your academic background makes you a qualified candidate  for 
% the  position.  If  you have practical work experience, point out 
% specific achievements or unique qualifications. Try not to repeat 
% the  same  information  the reader will find in the resume. Refer 
% the reader to the enclosed resume or application which summarizes 
% your  qualifications,  training,  and experiences. The purpose of 
% this section is to strengthen your resume  by  providing  details 
% which bring your experiences to life.
\noindent I learned about the UUV (Underwater Unmanned Vehicle) research
going on at the ATL (Advanced Technology Laboratory) from David. I have
not worked with underwater vehicles specifically, but I did research on
autonomous intelligent robots through the Freshman Research Initiative in
Spring 2013, under Todd Hester. Through the program, I gained experience
in using ROS and OpenCV to read and interpret sensor data, including sonar
and lidar sensors, to navigate segway robots autonomously. In this
position at ATL, I hope to use these skills to further advance the
UUV and other research projects, and to gain more experience in the
technologies you use.

% \noindent PARAGRAPH THREE: Request a personal interview and  indicate  your 
% flexibility as to the time and place. Repeat your phone number in 
% the letter and offer assistance to help in a speedy response. For 
% example,  state that you will be in the city where the company is 
% located on a certain date and would like to set up an  interview. 
% Or,  state  that  you  will  call  on a certain date to set up an 
% interview. End the letter by thanking  the  employer  for  taking 
% time to consider your credentials.
\noindent Thank you for your time, and I hope to hear back from you
soon. If you need to reach me, I prefer to be contacted by email at
\href{mailto:danielcheng@utexas.edu}{danielcheng@utexas.edu}, or
you can call me at \href{tel:12142127050}{(214) 212-7050}.

\closing{Sincerely yours,}
