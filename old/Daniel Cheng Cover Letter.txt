To Whom it May Concern,

My name is Daniel Cheng and I am a Computer Science honors student at UT Austin, pursuing a B.S. with Turing Scholars Honors degree.

I have six years of experience with Java and am familiar with C and C++. I am a hard-working student with an open mind and an eagerness to learn about how the skills I learned in school can apply in the real world. I enjoy learning new things and I admire the creativity and skill that goes into a well-designed product.

If there is anything else you need from me, or would like to talk discussing my qualifications, my email is danielcheng@utexas.edu and my cell phone number is (214) 212-7050. I prefer to be contacted via email.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Daniel Cheng
